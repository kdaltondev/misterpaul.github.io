    <p><b>Super Simple Web Page</b></p>
    <p>
      This is about as simple as a web page can get. To see the code (HTML) used to create it, Hit CTRL-SHIFT-I (Option + âŒ˜ + I on a Mac) and make sure you are in the elements tab. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the arrows to see how things like the &lt;p&gt; blocks contain the text of each paragraph. Play with editing the text and see the page change!
    </p>
    <p>
      Can you figure out what the title does? How about &lt;b&gt; and &lt;/b&gt;? What do you think is the point of the tags with / in them? (those things in &lt;&nbsp;&gt; brackets are called "tags.") Can you change the text? (you can't save your changes, though.)
