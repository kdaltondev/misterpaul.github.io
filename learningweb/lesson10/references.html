                    Mass of a water bottle alone: approximately 20 grams. This is for a 1 liter water bottle. 
                    <a href="http://www.petresin.org/news_didyouknow.asp#:~:text=The%20average%20weight%20of%20single,what%20it%20weighed%20in%202000">One reference</a>
                    from 2015 shows 1/2 liter bottle at 9.9 grams and a 2 liter bottle at 42 grams; these are minimal values (note they say "as little as") so average
                    values are likely higher. One surprising aspect of these numbers: typically with packaging, the ratio of packaging to product goes down as the amount of the product
                    increases. The numbers given for these plastic bottles is the opposite. A half-liter bottle at 9.9 grams is using 19.8 grams of plastic per liter, while the two liter bottle
                    at 42 grams is using 21 grams of plastic per liter of water.  So you actually would use less plastic if you buy four half-liter bottles instead of a single two-liter bottle!
                    Those values also appear to be just for the bottle, not the cap (which is typically a different plastic) nor the plastic label. Assume about 3 grams for the cap; we could measure this.
