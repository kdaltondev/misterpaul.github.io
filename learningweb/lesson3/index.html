            Lots of new things here!  
            <ol>
                <li>in the previous lesson, we used <font class=code>&lt;p&gt;</font> for each of our paragraphs.  In this lesson, we use <font class=code>&lt;div&gt;</font> instead. I don't really know the difference.  
                    You could google it, maybe search for "difference between p and div in HTML"</li>
                <li>this page has images in it.  You pull in images with the <font class=code>&lt;img&gt;</font> tag.</li>
                <li>There are different kinds of images. Our first image is a SVG (scaleable vector graphic) file and the second is a PNG (google it - I'm not sure what the N is).  You've also heard of GIF and maybe BMP (bitmap) files.
                    And there are many more.</li>
                <li>You also should see <font class=code>&lt;ol&gt;</font> and <font class=code>&lt;li&gt;</font> tags.</li>
            </ol> 
            <b>Activities</b>
            <ol>
                <li>Play around with the <font class=code>width</font> and <font class=code>height</font> in each image.  Make them small, make them huge.  Change the height/width ratio (do you know what that is?) Which image scales better?</li>
                <li>What happens when you change an <font class=code>&lt;ol&gt;</font> to <font class=code>&lt;ul&gt;</font>? 
                    What do you think <font class=code>&lt;ol&gt;</font>, <font class=code>&lt;ul&gt;</font> and <font class=code>&lt;li&gt;</font> mean?
                    Google them and find out.</li>
                <li>Challenge: create a style in the style sheet for your list items. What can you set? Can you find a list of things you can set? You might find it somewhere in the developer tools, or you can google.</li>
            </ol>
            The most important thing is to experiment with scaling the images.
