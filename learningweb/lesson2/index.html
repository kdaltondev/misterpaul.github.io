    <p><b>Super Simple Web Page</b></p>
    <p class=box>
        Here is another simple web page.  What changes do you notice? 
    </p>
    <p class=box>
        If you look in the <font class=code>&lt;head&gt;</font> section, you'll see a link to a stylesheet.
        The stylesheet lets us define styles, that change how the page and its components look. 
        If you change from the Elements tab to the Sources tab, you should see the file <font class=code>index.css</font> listed. That is the stylesheet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now go back to the Elements tab and look at the index.html file again. Notice that some of the <font class=code>&lt;p&gt;</font> tags now also contain <font class=code>class=box</font>. 
        You'll also see <font class=code>font</font> tags that call the class <font class=code>code</font>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Go back to the index.css file (under Sourcs). Change the background color of box to red. Yuck. Find a better color.  Play around with the font in the class <font class=code>code</font>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, to modify the HTML code, you need to be in the Elements tab, and to modify the stylesheet, you need to be in the Sources tab, so you may have to jumb back and forth a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Challenge:</b>> Edit the stylesheet and create a new style called <font class=code>.challenge</font> and set the background-color and text color (called just color).  
        Then edit the HTML and set this paragraph to your <font class=code>challenge</font> style.  (note that you do not use the dot in the HTML)
