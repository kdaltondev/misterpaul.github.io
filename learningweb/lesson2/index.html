    </p>
    <p class=box>
        If you look in the &lt;head&gt; section, you'll see a link to a stylesheet.
        The stylesheet lets us define styles, that change how the page and its components look. 
        If you change from the Elements tab to the Sources tab, you should see the file index.css listed. That is the stylesheet.
    </p>
    <p class=box>
        Now look at the index.html file again. (You can look at it under Elements again, or under the Sources tab.) Notice that some of the &lt;p&gt; tags now also contain <font class=code>class=box</font>.
